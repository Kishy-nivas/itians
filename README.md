# ITians Website
Thanks for visiting!  

This is our class website which we use to see our timetable and post notes. Last semester only I was managing the code but from this semester I have made it open source. Anybody from the class is encouraged to fork this repository, open issues and submit pull requests.

## Understanding the code
Do it yourself! (Just Kidding)  
For now, the code is pretty simple and has been commented. It is a nice place to start for absolute beginners. Still if you feel lost, contact me.
